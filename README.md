So this is a helpful tool to play a minecraft speedrunning category called SRG(Scouting and routing glitchless%)
So when u r performing the blind travel in this category u want to blind straight into the portal room
and as 1 block in the nether is 8 blocks in the overworld
So u want to divide the portal room coords by 8 and then make a blind at that coords
this manually takes a lot of time hence wasting the routing time and this tool helps there.
 
So to use this tool:-
stand in the portal room press f3+c and then paste in the first input
then press Enter or press the Generate button a command will automatically be copied to your clipboard
by using that command u will teleport to the exact blind travel coords in the nether.
